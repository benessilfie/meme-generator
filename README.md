# Meme Generator [Scrimba Module 11 Project]

This is a react project I built taking the Frontend Career Path at Scrimba.
Languages: Javascript(React), HTML, CSS

I had lots of fun building this project and I learnt a lot as well. Here's a couple of things I learnt:

- How to use React Hooks
- How to use UseState and UseEffect
- Conditional Rendering
- How to use the Fetch API
- Making API calls
- Using useEffect to fetch data from an API
